Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
0.18039964	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
0.18039964	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
0.1719489	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
0.1719489	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
0.16393393	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
0.15743968	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
0.15743968	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
0.15591304	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
0.15394711	However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
0.15394711	Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
3.1689343	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
2.9745536	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
2.6027346	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
2.1409621	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.0282495	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.0282495	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
1.7324512	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
1.5070261	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A??) chaperone to alter A?? aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).
1.4930091	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
1.4930091	Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.

Question: Which of the two CLU isoforms is the main one expressed in the choroid plexus?
2.1167316	Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.
1.9064517	In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.
1.5411277	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).
1.3772688	Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]).
0.6046128	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].
0.5344073	Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs.
0.5344073	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.5344073	The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2???3 boundary.
0.5344073	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
0.5344073	One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35].

Question: Which clusterin single nucleotide polymorphism has been linked to a reduction in the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease?
0.49310842	Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
0.22792386	(2010) Genetic variability in CLU and its association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.22695337	Introduction Top Clusterin (CLU, APOJ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in [1], [2], [3], [4]).
0.18993655	Find this article online (1997) Consensus recommendations for the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.18253516	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.
0.15194924	The National Institute on Aging, and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease.
0.094968274	Find this article online Aksenov MY, Tucker HM, Nair P, Aksenova MV, Butterfield DA, et al. (1999) The expression of several mitochondrial and nuclear genes encoding the subunits of electron transport chain enzyme complexes, cytochrome c oxidase, and NADH dehydrogenase, in different brain regions in Alzheimer's disease.
0.083281435	Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.
0.078518495	Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk.
0.078518495	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.

Question: Which CLU protein isoforms in the brain have been characterized?
0.108185366	We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain.

0.09015447	In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.
0.09015447	Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample.
0.09015447	Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain.
0.09015447	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
0.09015447	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
0.07212357	Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain.

2.8528914	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).
2.6720476	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].

Question: Which particular histone deacetylase inhibitor has been shown to enhance the expression of CLU? 
0.4597827	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.
0.44276515	Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression.
0.4251052	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.
0.42473587	For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations).
0.41953453	The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately.
0.415489	While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.
0.40185097	Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39].
0.38242316	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
0.32674897	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.2884509	Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk.

Question: Which entity does allosterically regulate insulin degrading enzyme activity?
0.52045995	It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and ??-amyloid [8], [38].
0.23001295	Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].
0.22770123	Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A??, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.
0.19517247	Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); ??-amyloid (1???40) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA).
0.16264373	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A?? degradation [4]???[6].
0.13011499	Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism: Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1, Chiara Ciaccio1, Diego Sbardella1,2, Mariaserena Boraso3, Barbara Viviani3, Massimiliano Coletta1,2, Stefano Marini1*1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy, 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems, Bari, Italy, 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy

Question: Which peptide hormone is the positive transcriptional regulator of IDE?
0.44742537	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A?? degradation.
0.40808907	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
0.40808907	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
0.40808907	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
0.40265787	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
0.40265787	The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A?? levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration.
0.3922614	The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real
0.3922614	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
0.37643367	In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration.
0.37643367	As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A).
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: In which cell line was the gene expression regulation of IDE characterized?
0.6036339	It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown).
0.24088809	g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used.
0.15055506	BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 ??g/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM).
0.12924966	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A?? degradation.
0.12185773	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.10770804	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
0.10662552	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
0.10662552	g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression
0.10662552	We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17].
0.10553189	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A?? catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Which method was applied to measure the quantity of IDE mRNA in the gene regulation experiments described in the paper?
1.1247009	A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).
0.29101583	Find this article online Bradford MM (1976) A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.
0.1422838	(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns).

0.08892737	Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs.

Question: What regulates the production of neprilysin?
1.8173914	In addition to their ability to phagocyte ??-amyloid, microglia can also clear A?? by degradation through the production of A??-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39].
0.7819834	Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22].
0.6255867	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A?? degradation [4]???[6].
0.42466348	IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions.

Question: What kind of glial cell is able to phagocyte b-amyloid?
0.22317353	A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34].
0.22317353	Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague???Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy).

Question: What substance exhibited a similar effect on  IDE secretion as achieved by somatostatin?
1.8136581	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
1.6829219	Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.
1.3816465	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
1.1386507	Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with ??-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates.
0.8283507	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.7717815	Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.
0.7717815	It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20].
0.7620758	In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A??, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A?? deposition.
0.7474438	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A?? catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
0.7434969	As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A?? accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.

Question: What are the sst receptors that are expressed on rat astrocytes?
4.7357655	In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1).
0.9060106	Rat Astrocytes were incubated with indicated concentrations of somatostatin.

Question: What method was used to inhibit the expression of IDE?
1.9940443	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
1.9940443	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
1.9940443	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
1.8697534	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
1.8500082	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
1.7745137	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
1.7454627	Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
1.7454627	It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of ??-amyloid in the brain.
1.7454627	Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples indicates that no detectable effect of IDE expression is observed (left panel).

Question: What effect can be observed when when ??-secretase is blocked? 
1.6556685	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the ??-secretase.
1.4158947	In vitro ??-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].
1.4158947	In vitro ??-secretase activity assays
1.3587526	(A) Schematic representation of the ??-secretase purification process.
1.2444687	The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting ??-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry.
1.2444687	Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct ??-secretase subtypes.
1.2444687	Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of ??-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations.
1.2444687	They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting ??-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58].
1.2444687	For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for ??-secretase purification.
1.2444687	Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 ??L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro ??-secretase assays.

Question: When APH1 genes are overexpressed in MEF KO what happens with the A???
2.5915165	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A?? species [24].
1.5105717	Indeed, ??-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.

1.4777013	Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 ??g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 ??g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 ??g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV).
1.4219187	Editor: Stefano L. Sensi, University G. D'Annunzio, Italy
1.4219187	The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000?? g for 1 h at 4??C and stored at ???80??C until use.
1.4219187	The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000?? g for 1 h at 4??C in a SW32
1.137535	Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000?? g for 20 min at 4??C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge.

Question: What experimental technique was used specifically to purify the ??-secretase complex?
2.1082993	3) Solubilisation of ??-secretase complexes.
1.8991532	Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of ??-secretase complexes as described below.
1.6900074	Another possible explanation would be that purified ??-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins.
1.5854343	As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different ??-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses.
1.5402372	A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified ??-secretase complexes.
1.5402372	PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the ??-secretase complex.
1.5402372	To do so, ??-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate.
1.4356642	Note that the levels of A?? produced from FAD-linked ??-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit.
1.4356642	One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of ??-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations.

Question: Which amino acid is critical for the activity of the PS1 protein?
0.63252926	Membrane protein extracts were prepared and ??-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A).

Question: What mutation of the PS1 protein causes ??-secretase activity almost to disappear?
1.1013893	Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of ??-secretase activity.
0.9335576	Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ??E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of ??-secretase activity.
0.92976046	In vitro ??-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].

0.7185262	The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of ??-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A??1???40, A??1???42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.
0.7132798	To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect ??-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity.
0.68599284	The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting ??-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry.

0.13108945	Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified ??-Secretase Complexes
0.13108945	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by ??-secretase have been reported.
0.13108945	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.11470327	Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong ??-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A??1???42/A??1???40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.11470327	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.
